GPS2FTP
-------
An app for Android devices which updates the current gps position to a defined sftp server.
So far only useful in order when you want to update your personal website with your current gps location. 

As an example or first use case we forked the free Bootstrap template of David Miller (https://twitter.com/davidmillerskt)
https://github.com/Le-Space/startbootstrap-grayscale 

**(please use our fork as long its not included in the main project!)**
Examples: see www.le-space.de or www.irinasenko.com (scroll down to the bottom of the page)
